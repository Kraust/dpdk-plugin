ESnet::DPDK
=================================

DPDK function order:

          ( DPDK::Open is called )
    01. Initialize the EAL (rte_eal_init)
    02. Ensure we have at least one port (rte_eth_dev_count_avail)
    03. Create the mbuf (rte_pktmbuf_pool_create)
          ( port_init is called )
    04. Double-check (rte_eth_dev_is_valid_port)
    05. Get device info (rte_eth_dev_info_get)
    06. Configure the port (rte_eth_dev_configure)
    07. Set the MTU (rte_eth_dev_set_mtu)
    08. Adjust the number of queue descriptors (rte_eth_dev_adjust_nb_rx_tx_desc)
    09. Configure the number of queues (rte_eth_rx_queue_setup)
    10. Start the port (rte_eth_dev_start)
    11. Enable promiscuous mode (rte_eth_promiscuous_enable)
         ( port_init returns )
    12. Check for NUMA proximity (rte_eth_dev_socket_id, rte_socket_id)
    13. Tell Zeek that we've opened the port (Opened)
         ( DPDK::Process )
    14. Get a bunch of packets (rte_eth_rx_burst)
    15. Send them to Zeek (dispatch_packet)
    16. Free the mbuf memory once Zeek is done (rte_pktmbuf_free)
